Material UI - by Manveen

Material UI is our favourite React UI library and to be fair there isn't even a second UI library for React that we can even recommend. For a multitude of reasons, creating a good UI library is incredibly tough. It's not simply the amount of work required to create components that are usable and look great; these components must also be well documented, have working examples, and support an infinite number of edge cases such as responsiveness, accessibility, translation, theming, and so on. 

This video https://youtu.be/CrHQBzwus3s can help the beginners to go through Material UI installing, usage, styling, templates and more. 

How to Use Material UI Documentation: Click the upper left menu on the Material UI website to open a sidebar. The key difference between these two sections is that the Components section contains examples/demo and explanations for each component, whilst the Component API section contains a comprehensive list of all properties and CSS rules/classes for each component (and no examples). Each component appears in both parts, allowing for a clear distinction between exploring and verifying exact property names. 

Material UI examples: When exploring how to use Material UI, you'll spend the majority of your time in the Components area. The most significant aspect of each component is that there are generally functioning examples on the page that you can test out. 

One can see the full source code for each example by simply clicking on the code icon: < > for each example. What you generally see on each component is a snippet of how to use the component, but more than likely you're going to want to see how that component was being used, the CSS that was applied, 

and the full list of imports. As a result, you should always click the "display the complete source" icon. You can also click "Edit in CodeSandbox" to see the example in action right away.Best of all, these examples actually work, so you can copy the whole code into your project, and then import the example into your project with no effort. The examples are usually creative and utilise a variety of Material UI features.
